## [Hebrews 12:28](verseid:58.12.28)   (KJV)

28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

[Eph 3:9](verseid:49.3.9)  And to make all _men_ see what _is_ the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
	[Rev 10:7](verseid:66.10.7)  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
## [Ephesians 3:12](verseid:49.3.12)   (KJV)

12  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

## [2 Timothy 1:7](verseid:55.1.7)   (KJV)

7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
