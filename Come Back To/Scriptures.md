## [Hebrews 12:28](verseid:58.12.28)   (KJV)

28  Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

[Eph 3:9](verseid:49.3.9)  And to make all _men_ see what _is_ the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
	[Rev 10:7](verseid:66.10.7)  But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.
## [Ephesians 3:12](verseid:49.3.12)   (KJV)

12  In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.

## [2 Timothy 1:7](verseid:55.1.7)   (KJV)

7  For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

[Rev 11:19](verseid:66.11.19)  And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.

[Revelation 6:10-11](verseid:66.6.10)
10  And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not udge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?
11  And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

Rev 20:5
5  But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection

[Revelation 20:12](verseid:66.20.12)

[Revelation 13:10](verseid:66.13.10)
10  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

[Dan 7:26](verseid:27.7.26)  But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
	[Rev 12:10](verseid:66.12.10)  And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 
	[Rev 12:11](verseid:66.12.11)  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
	[Rev 12:12](verseid:66.12.12)  Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.

Keeping Our garments

[Rev 16:14](verseid:66.16.14)  For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

41  Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

36  Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

[Act 20:29](verseid:44.20.29)  For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.

[1Pe 4:2](verseid:60.4.2)  That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
[1Pe 4:3](verseid:60.4.3)  For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:
[1Pe 4:4](verseid:60.4.4)  Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:
[1Pe 4:5](verseid:60.4.5)  Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.
[1Pe 4:6](verseid:60.4.6)  For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
[1Pe 4:7](verseid:60.4.7)  But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.
[1Pe 4:8](verseid:60.4.8)  And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
