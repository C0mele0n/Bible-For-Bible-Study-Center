Sure, letâ€™s delve deeper into the services in the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place of the Mosaic Tabernacle.

[**Daily Services in the Holy Place:** The daily services in the Holy Place were performed by the priests and included the following](https://www.jesuswalk.com/moses/7_tabernacle.htm)[1](https://www.jesuswalk.com/moses/7_tabernacle.htm)[2](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[3](https://israelmyglory.org/article/the-high-priest-christ-in-the-sanctuary/):

1. [**Tending the Gold Lampstand:** The priests would ensure that the lamps on the lampstand were kept burning at all times](https://israelmyglory.org/article/the-high-priest-christ-in-the-sanctuary/)[3](https://israelmyglory.org/article/the-high-priest-christ-in-the-sanctuary/).
2. [**Renewing the Table of Showbread:** Every week, the priests would replace the twelve loaves of bread that were kept on the table](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[2](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm).
3. [**Burning Incense on the Golden Altar:** The priests would burn incense on the golden altar every morning and evening](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[2](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm).

[These daily services were a part of the regular worship and service to God, maintaining a constant connection between the Israelites and their deity](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[2](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm).

[**Services on the Day of Atonement in the Most Holy Place:** The services in the Most Holy Place were performed once a year, on the Day of Atonement](https://www.bibleoutlines.com/hebrews-91-10-worship-under-the-old-covenant-system/)[4](https://www.bibleoutlines.com/hebrews-91-10-worship-under-the-old-covenant-system/)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[6](https://www.gotquestions.org/Most-Holy-Place.html). [The High Priest would perform a series of rituals, including](https://www.jesuswalk.com/moses/7_tabernacle.htm)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[7](https://jesuscandoit.com/day-of-atonement-significance/):

1. [**Bathing and Changing Garments:** The High Priest would bathe and change into a pure white linen robe to symbolize repentance](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180).
2. [**Making a Sin Offering:** The High Priest would make a sin offering for himself and the other priests by sacrificing a young bull and a ram](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180).
3. [**Entering the Most Holy Place:** The High Priest would then enter the Most Holy Place with a pan of glowing coals from the altar of incense, filling the air with a smoky cloud and aroma of incense](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180).
4. [**Sprinkling the Blood:** The High Priest would sprinkle the blood of the sacrificial animal on the Ark of the Covenant to atone for the sins of the people](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180)[5](https://www.learnreligions.com/day-of-atonement-700180).

[The goal of the Day of Atonement was to cleanse the people and the sanctuary from sin, symbolizing the purification and reconciliation of the people with God](https://www.bibleoutlines.com/hebrews-91-10-worship-under-the-old-covenant-system/)[4](https://www.bibleoutlines.com/hebrews-91-10-worship-under-the-old-covenant-system/).

As for your second question, the blood of sacrifices was not brought into the sanctuary daily. [The blood was only brought into the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113)[8](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113). [On this day, the High Priest would sprinkle the blood of a bull and a goat on the Ark of the Covenant to atone for the sins of the people](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113)[8](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113). [This act symbolized the purification and reconciliation of the people with God](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113)[8](https://www.learnreligions.com/tabernacle-offerings-700113). [The daily sacrifices were performed at the altar of burnt offering in the court of the tabernacle](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[2](http://www.projectrestore.com/library/whispers/04_daily_services.htm)[9](https://www.crossway.org/articles/the-provision-of-sacrifice-in-the-old-testament/). [These sacrifices were a part of the regular worship and service to God](https://www.crossway.org/articles/the-provision-of-sacrifice-in-the-old-testament/)[9](https://www.crossway.org/articles/the-provision-of-sacrifice-in-the-old-testament/).

In summary, the daily services in the Holy Place were a part of the regular worship and service to God, maintaining a constant connection between the Israelites and their deity. On the other hand, the services in the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement were a special annual event focused on atonement and reconciliation. The blood of sacrifices was only brought into the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement, not daily. Both were crucial aspects of the spiritual life of the Israelites, but they served different purposes and were carried out in different ways.
