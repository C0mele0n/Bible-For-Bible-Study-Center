[Heb 10:19](verseid:58.10.19)  Having therefore, brethren, boldness ==to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus==,
[Heb 10:20](verseid:58.10.20)  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, ==through the veil, that is to say, his flesh==;
[Heb 10:21](verseid:58.10.21)  And _having_ an high priest over the house of God;
[Heb 10:22](verseid:58.10.22)  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

[Heb 9:1](verseid:58.9.1)  Then verily the first _covenant_ had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly ==sanctuary==.
[Heb 9:2](verseid:58.9.2)  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein _was_ the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; ==which is called the sanctuary==.
[Heb 9:3](verseid:58.9.3)  And ==after the second veil==, the tabernacle ==which is called the Holiest of all==;
[Heb 9:4](verseid:58.9.4)  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein _was_ the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
[Heb 9:5](verseid:58.9.5)  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

[Heb 9:8](verseid:58.9.8)  ==The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing==:
[Heb 9:9](verseid:58.9.9)  Which _was_ ==a figure for the time then present==, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, ==that could not make him that did the service perfect==, as pertaining to the conscience;
[Heb 9:10](verseid:58.9.10)  _Which stood_ only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed _on them_ ==until the time of reformation==.

> *Notice that the Bible relates the ministry of the holy place (within the first compartment) to the carnal ordinances which were imposed upon God's people until the time of reformation (the time of Christ: who preached to repent because such time was at hand)*. In other words, it talks about the first compartment as being a part of the types and not the antitype. It also said that the way to the most holy (which it says means Heaven) was not made known until Christ came and revealed it. This means that the way to Heaven (the "holiest of all") was given in Christ when He came, died for us, and then the Comforter came. Christ brought the increase of knowledge concerning the way to Heaven (which Hebrews 9:8 says was not yet known before: meaning Daniel didn't even have such knowledge). Daniel shows prophecy pre-Christ, and Revelation, being post-Christ, is the unsealing of Daniel (and more). Christ is the one Who unseals (Rev 5).

### Causing the oblation to cease
[Dan 9:26](verseid:27.9.26)  And after threescore and two weeks shall ==Messiah be cut off==, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof _shall be_ with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
[Dan 9:27](verseid:27.9.27)  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and ==in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease==, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make _it_ desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

[Heb 10:15](verseid:58.10.15)  _Whereof_ the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
[Heb 10:16](verseid:58.10.16)  This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, ==I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them==;
[Heb 10:17](verseid:58.10.17)  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
[Heb 10:18](verseid:58.10.18)  ==Now== where remission of these _is, ==there is_ no more offering for sin==.
[Heb 10:19](verseid:58.10.19)  ==Having== therefore, brethren, ==boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus==,
> *Where can we locate the ending of offerings for sin? At Calvary! It says "now where... there is no more offering" and follows with the result: having "boldness to enter ==into the holiest== by the blood of Jesus". We've seen that holiest means the second compartment ("Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant..."). So then, seeing that the offerings have stopped, and the is indeed remission for sins, we can only reasonably conclude that the wherewithal to enter bodly into the most holy has been given since Christ concluded His ministry on earth and the Spirit was given (Heb 9:8). 
> Take notice that these scriptures (Heb 10:15-18) are the immediate context behind v19 and onward (which started this document)*. Also notice that both Heb 10:15 and Heb 9:8 are qualified by the Holy Ghost. This is not an arbitrary coincidence. 

### Calvary brought the conclusion
[Dan 9:24](verseid:27.9.24)  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to ==finish the transgression==, and to ==make an end of sins==, and to ==make reconciliation for iniquity==, and to ==bring in everlasting righteousness==, and to ==seal up the vision and prophecy==, and to ==anoint the most Holy==.

> There are many things, which this verse (and its surrounding verses) covers, that are valuable for us to pay attention to, in order to understand Christ's antitypical sanctuary work. However, we will focus only on some key points:
> 1. Dan 9:24-27 shows all of those things listed in verse 24 as being a part of the work done for us in the year of Christ's death, resurrection and ascension, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. All those things are the result, or conclusion of such work. 
> 2. Righteousness that is everlasting is righteousness that never ends, and if it was brought in, that means it wasnt everlasting before. Now consider the following:
>    [Rev 22:10](verseid:66.22.10)  And he saith unto me, ==Seal not== the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for ==the time is at hand==.
>    [Rev 22:11](verseid:66.22.11)  He that is unjust, let him be unjust ==still==: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ==still==: and ==he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still==.  ⛳️
> 	   Does not verse 10 carry the same language that Christ (the "Messiah" Who Daniel learned of) Himself brought at the beginning of His ministry and then later told His disciples to preach as well (Mat 4:17, Mrk 1:15, Mat 10:7)? Is Christ ("the Lamb") not the One Who unseals the vision (Rev 5:5-7, Rev 6:1 and onward)?
> 	   Does not verse 11 speak to the same effect as Dan 9:24+27 (where righteousness that remains is brought in, and desolation brought in to the end that that which is desolate receives judgment {"==even until== the consummation, and ==that determined shall be poured== upon the desolate"} )?
> 	   Many apply Rev 22:11 to describe the effect of receiving the seal of God or the mark of the beast. Because of its impact on this study topic (Christ's antitypical sanctuary work), we will go a little more into the seal of God further down.
>    3. You might think "how could Christ seal up the vision, yet unseal the vision at the same time?". Bring in what is laid out in the following passages: Isa 29:10-14, Mat 11:25, Mat 13:10-11, Mat 16:17, Zech 7:12, Mat 13:15, Mrk 4:12, Jhn 3:19, 2Th 2:15-16. Does the Bible tell us to only regard Rev 22:11 as applying in the future? Dan 9:24, in combination with Heb 9:14, Jer 31:31-33,  ⛳️
>    4. What is meant by "anoint the most holy"?  ⛳️

### Two different orders
[Heb 6:17](verseid:58.6.17)  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ==shew unto the heirs of promise== the immutability of his counsel, confirmed _it_ by an oath:
[Heb 6:18](verseid:58.6.18)  That by two immutable things, in which _it was_ impossible for God to lie, ==we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us==:
[Heb 6:19](verseid:58.6.19)  ==Which _hope_ we have as an anchor of the soul==, both sure and stedfast, and ==which entereth into that within the veil==;
[Heb 6:20](verseid:58.6.20)  ==Whither the forerunner is for us entered, _even_ Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec==.

> *Hebrews chapter 7 is dedicated to explaining the "order of Melchisedec", its contrast, in superiority and nature, to the levitical priesthood, and more about Christ being after that order. Melchisedec, unlike Aaron the high priest, was a ==king and priest at the same time==: not merely one (as Aaron), or one before the other (Jhn 18:33-37, Mat 28:9+18). This considerably changes the dynamic and impact of Christ's priestly role vs Aaron's. The tabernacle system given to Moses, though it all taught the principles of Christ in figures, was arranged for the levitical priesthood and not for that of Melchisedech. Therefore, in considering many things from Hebrews 7 alone, one can already start to see that, though the types contained the principles of Heaven, ==their carnal features (such as the physical setup, the articles, the services in all exaction, etc) were not a 1:1 comparison with the Heavenly==. 

> Keeping in mind that the earthly sanctuary system, which was given to Moses, was fashioned for the levitical priesthood, we must account for the imperfection of those carrying out its services as being a factor in shaping the services themselves:

[Heb 7:27](verseid:58.7.27)  ==Who needeth not daily==, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

> Where did the daily work take place within the sanctuary? It was within the court and the first compartment. Considering the explanation of what is meant by "holiest of all" in Heb 9:1-3, the relation of the first compartment to the types in Heb 9:8-10, and the contrast of the levitical priests from Christ in Heb 7:27, what can we say? Has Christ "skipped" the first compartment to enter within the second veil and work as Priest before the Father? Heb 9:1-10 relates the 1st compartment of the sanctuary to the old covenant. 

[Heb 7:18](verseid:58.7.18)  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before ==for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof==.
[Heb 7:19](verseid:58.7.19)  For ==the law made nothing perfect==, but the bringing in of a better hope _did;_ by the which we draw nigh unto God.

## [Acts 13:39](verseid:44.13.39)   (KJV)

39  And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.

## [Hebrews 8:7-8](verseid:58.8.7)   (KJV)

7  For if that first _covenant_ had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.

8  For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:

## [Hebrews 10:1-4](verseid:58.10.1)   (KJV)

1  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, _and_ not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.

2  For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.

3  But in those _sacrifices there is_ a remembrance again _made_ of sins every year.

4  For _it is_ not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.


## [Romans 8:3](verseid:45.8.3)   (KJV)

3  For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

## [Hebrews 7:11-12](verseid:58.7.11)   (KJV)

11  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need _was there_ that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

12  For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

[Heb 7:23](verseid:58.7.23)  And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
[Heb 7:24](verseid:58.7.24)  But this _man,_ because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
