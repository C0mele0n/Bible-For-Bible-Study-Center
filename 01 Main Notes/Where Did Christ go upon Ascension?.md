[Heb 10:20](verseid:58.10.20)  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, ==through the veil, that is to say, his flesh==;
[Heb 10:21](verseid:58.10.21)  And _having_ an high priest over the house of God;
[Heb 10:22](verseid:58.10.22)  Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

[Heb 9:1](verseid:58.9.1)  Then verily the first _covenant_ had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly ==sanctuary==.
[Heb 9:2](verseid:58.9.2)  For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein _was_ the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; ==which is called the sanctuary==.
[Heb 9:3](verseid:58.9.3)  And ==after the second veil==, the tabernacle ==which is called the Holiest of all==;
[Heb 9:4](verseid:58.9.4)  Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein _was_ the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
[Heb 9:5](verseid:58.9.5)  And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.

[Heb 9:8](verseid:58.9.8)  ==The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing==:
[Heb 9:9](verseid:58.9.9)  Which _was_ ==a figure for the time then present==, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, ==that could not make him that did the service perfect==, as pertaining to the conscience;
[Heb 9:10](verseid:58.9.10)  _Which stood_ only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed _on them_ ==until the time of reformation==.

> *Notice that the Bible relates the ministry of the holy place (within the first compartment) to the carnal ordinances which were imposed upon God's people until the time of reformation (the time of Christ: who preached to repent because such time was at hand)*. In other words, it talks about the first compartment as being a part of the types and not the antitype. It also said that the way to the most holy (which it says means Heaven) was not made known until Christ came and revealed it. This means that the way to Heaven (the "holiest of all") was given in Christ when He came, died for us, and then the Comforter came. Christ brought the increase of knowledge concerning the way to Heaven (which Hebrews 9:8 says was not yet known before: meaning Daniel didn't even have such knowledge). Daniel shows prophecy pre-Christ, and Revelation, being post-Christ, is the unsealing of Daniel (and more). Christ is the one Who unseals (Rev 5).

### Causing the oblation to cease
[Dan 9:26](verseid:27.9.26)  And after threescore and two weeks shall ==Messiah be cut off==, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof _shall be_ with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
[Dan 9:27](verseid:27.9.27)  And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and ==in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease==, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make _it_ desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

[Heb 10:15](verseid:58.10.15)  _Whereof_ the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
[Heb 10:16](verseid:58.10.16)  This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, ==I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them==;
[Heb 10:17](verseid:58.10.17)  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
[Heb 10:18](verseid:58.10.18)  ==Now== where remission of these _is, ==there is_ no more offering for sin==.
[Heb 10:19](verseid:58.10.19)  ==Having== therefore, brethren, ==boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus==,
> *Where can we locate the ending of offerings for sin? At Calvary! It says "now where... there is no more offering" and follows with the result: having "boldness to enter ==into the holiest== by the blood of Jesus". We've seen that holiest means the second compartment ("Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant..."). So then, seeing that the offerings have stopped, and the is indeed remission for sins, we can only reasonably conclude that the wherewithal to enter bodly into the most holy has been given since Christ concluded His ministry on earth and the Spirit was given (Heb 9:8). 
> Take notice that these scriptures (Heb 10:15-18) are the immediate context behind v19 and onward (which started this document)*. Also notice that both Heb 10:15 and Heb 9:8 are qualified by the Holy Ghost. This is not an arbitrary coincidence. 

### Calvary brought the conclusion
[Dan 9:24](verseid:27.9.24)  Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to ==finish the transgression==, and to ==make an end of sins==, and to ==make reconciliation for iniquity==, and to ==bring in everlasting righteousness==, and to ==seal up the vision and prophecy==, and to ==anoint the most Holy==.

> There are many things, which this verse (and its surrounding verses) covers, that are valuable for us to pay attention to, in order to understand Christ's antitypical sanctuary work. However, we will focus only on some key points:
> 1. Dan 9:24-27 shows all of those things listed in verse 24 as being a part of the work done for us in the year of Christ's death, resurrection and ascension, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. All those things are the result, or conclusion of such work. 
> 2. Righteousness that is everlasting is righteousness that never ends, and if it was brought in, that means the . Now consider the following:
>    [Rev 22:10](verseid:66.22.10)  And he saith unto me, ==Seal not== the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for ==the time is at hand==.
>    [Rev 22:11](verseid:66.22.11)  He that is unjust, let him be unjust ==still==: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ==still==: and ==he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still==.  
> 	   - Does not verse 10 carry the same language that Christ (the "Messiah" Who Daniel learned of) Himself brought at the beginning of His ministry and then later told His disciples to preach as well (Mat 4:17, Mrk 1:15, Mat 10:7)? Is Christ ("the Lamb") not the One Who unseals the vision (Rev 5:5-7, Rev 6:1 and onward)? It was declared to John that the time was currently at hand and not that it would be some day in the distant future. 
> 	   - Does not verse 11 speak to the same effect as Dan 9:24+27 (where righteousness , which remains, is brought in, and desolation brought in to prepare for the judgment {"==even until== the consummation, and ==that determined shall be poured== upon the desolate"} )?
> 	   - Many apply Rev 22:11 to describe the effect of receiving the seal of God or the mark of the beast. Because of its impact on this study topic (Christ's antitypical sanctuary work), we will go a little more into the seal of God further down.
> 	   - You might think "how could Christ seal up the vision, yet unseal the vision at the same time?". Bring in what is laid out in the following passages: Isa 29:10-14, Mat 11:25, Mat 13:10-11, Mat 16:17, Zech 7:12, Mat 13:15, Mrk 4:12, Jhn 3:19, 2Th 2:15-16. Does the Bible tell us to only regard Rev 22:11 as applying in the future: right before his second coming? If so, why would the Angel proclaim that the time is at hand and that john should "seal not"? Are we merely to think that "the time is at hand" means that it wasn't really at hand in John's day, but a foreshadowing? Why then was John himself told to "seal not"? We would have to say that John, the first recipient of the message in this instance, was not able to follow such instruction himself, but rather that the angel was only speaking to those whom John represented. Why then did he follow the instruction and record the things he witnessed, which we now read? Why does the entry of the book of revelation say that "the time is at hand" (in Rev 1:3)? Rev 1:3 shows that the instruction to "seal not" was not given to John in some isolated foreshadowing of a future time (where John is not really the one being spoken to but rather those whom he represents). The book rather establishes, from its very beginning, that, in general, the time ==is {currently}== at hand. That means that it was true at the time that it was written. So then, we cannot only apply Rev 22:11 to a future time. We must also see it having bearing upon the time the John himself was in.
> 	   - Furthermore: would God give John instruction (as He gave Daniel instruction to seal, and Daniel followed), knowing that He couldn't follow it? Yes, God speaks to many when He speaks to one (and those things are indeed instruction for us who live now), but, Daniel wasn't skipped when given the instruction, and John was told to seal not the , which is why we have the book in the first place: and access to the understanding of the book: even every other book. Why? Because it is revealed in Christ, Who opened up Heaven to us by His work , teachings, and the giving of the Holy Spirit to be accessed freely by all who ask in faith. Lastly, verse 9 shows us the type of instruction being given to John. John bowed to the angel, thus the angel was speaking to and instructing ==John himself ==. Seeing that the angel continues to speak to him in the next verses, it further shows that the angel meant the time was at hand in John's time, and that verse 11 was a part of it. In Other words: he was told to not seal the things which he was given, but record and share them: whether people will hear or forbare, the revelation of Christ, which was given to John, would decide people's destiny (Ezk 2:5, Mat 10:12-15, Act 13:46, Ezk 3:19, Ezk 33:9, John 15:22, John 3:18-21). 
>    3. What is meant by "anoint the most holy"? How is the most holy anointed? Exodus chapter 40 shows us that the anointing of the sanctuary happens with oil and is done as the very elements of the sanctuary system are being setup. So, bringing that forward to Dan 9:24, the anointing of the most holy is in connection with setting up the most holy. When you connect this with the various things we've seen about Christ's ascension into the place and work of the most holy (which was identified as being the most holy place, and not both the holy place and most holy place), it makes sense. Christ began the work of High priest (after the order of Melchisedek), in the most holy, upon His ascension. The question still remains: what does it mean that the most holy was "anointed" in Heaven? Let's look more upon this:

[Psa 2:6](verseid:19.2.6)  Yet have ==I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion==.
[Psa 2:7](verseid:19.2.7)  I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, ==Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee==.
[Psa 2:8](verseid:19.2.8)  Ask of me, and I shall ==give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession==.
[Psa 2:9](verseid:19.2.9)  ==Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.==
> - verse 2 establishes the event of Christ being established upon the hill of Zion. He was already established in Heaven, therefore this prophecies about Him being established upon His people on earth (Who lost Him prior). This prophecy is about the kingly priesthood (Heb 7:1, Heb 6:20, Heb 5:6+10) of Christ, which He came to set up when He came to earth.
> -  verse 7 was declared by God later at Christ's baptism. Such proclamation confirmed the fulfilled prophecy of Christ's coming by Daniel and many others.
> - In connection with Him being the established King over Zion is that His enemies are given into His hand. Considering Col 3:1, Rev 3:21, Rev 5:6, we can see that the following scriptures show that Psa 2:6-9 is about Christ's work on earth and His work after ascending: [Psa 110:1](verseid:19.110.1)  A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, ==Sit thou at my right hand==, ==until I make thine enemies thy footstool==. [Psa 110:2](verseid:19.110.2)  The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
> Let's continue to learn about the anointing of the Most Holy:

[Heb 1:8](verseid:58.1.8)  But unto the Son _he saith,_ Thy throne, O God, _is_ for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness _is_ the sceptre of thy kingdom.
[Heb 1:9](verseid:58.1.9)  Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, _even_ thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
> Just as we saw the priests were anointed in the same time as the whole sanctuary system was first reared up, so Christ was anointed before He started His work. This work was that which brought the world from the types (old covenant; Old Testament: wherein was the daily oblation) to the antitype (the new covenant; new testament: wherein there was taken away the need/usefulness for daily oblation).

[Luk 4:18](verseid:42.4.18)  The Spirit of the Lord _is_ upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
[Luk 4:19](verseid:42.4.19)  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[Luk 4:20](verseid:42.4.20)  And he closed the book, and he gave _it_ again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[Luk 4:21](verseid:42.4.21)  And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.

[Act 10:38](verseid:44.10.38)  How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.

[Jhn 3:34](verseid:43.3.34)  For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure _unto him._

[Isa 11:2](verseid:23.11.2)  ==And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him==, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;
[Isa 11:3](verseid:23.11.3)  And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:
[Isa 11:4](verseid:23.11.4)  But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and ==he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked==.
> Here we see the reference of the "rod of iron" following the proclaimation that Christ is the Son of God: just like we saw in Psalms 2:6-9. We see that the levitical priests began their priesthood at 30 (Num 4:3+23), and so did Christ.

[Luk 3:21](verseid:42.3.21)  Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
[Luk 3:22](verseid:42.3.22)  And ==the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him==, and ==a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased==.
[Luk 3:23](verseid:42.3.23)  And ==Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age==, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was _the son_ of Heli,

### Two different orders
[Heb 6:17](verseid:58.6.17)  Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ==shew unto the heirs of promise== the immutability of his counsel, confirmed _it_ by an oath:
[Heb 6:18](verseid:58.6.18)  That by two immutable things, in which _it was_ impossible for God to lie, ==we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us==:
[Heb 6:19](verseid:58.6.19)  ==Which _hope_ we have as an anchor of the soul==, both sure and stedfast, and ==which entereth into that within the veil==;
[Heb 6:20](verseid:58.6.20)  ==Whither the forerunner is for us entered, _even_ Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec==.

> *Hebrews chapter 7 is dedicated to explaining the "order of Melchisedec", its contrast, in superiority and nature, to the levitical priesthood, and more about Christ being after that order. Melchisedec, unlike Aaron the high priest, was a ==king and priest at the same time==: not merely one (as Aaron), or one before the other (Jhn 18:33-37, Mat 28:9+18). This considerably changes the dynamic and impact of Christ's priestly role vs Aaron's. The tabernacle system given to Moses, though it all taught the principles of Christ in figures, was arranged for the levitical priesthood and not for that of Melchisedech. Therefore, in considering many things from Hebrews 7 alone, one can already start to see that, though the types contained the principles of Heaven, ==their carnal features (such as the physical setup, the articles, the services in all exaction, etc) were not a 1:1 comparison with the Heavenly==. 

> Keeping in mind that the earthly sanctuary system, which was given to Moses, was fashioned for the levitical priesthood, we must account for the imperfection of those carrying out its services as being a factor in shaping the services themselves:

[Heb 7:27](verseid:58.7.27)  ==Who needeth not daily, as those high priests==, to offer up sacrifice, ==first for his own sins==, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

> Where did the daily work take place within the sanctuary system? It was done in the court and the first compartment (itself being called "the sanctuary"). Considering the explanation of what is meant by "holiest of all" in Heb 9:1-3, the relation of the first compartment to the types in Heb 9:8-10, and the contrast of the levitical priests from Christ in Heb 7:27, what can we say? Has Christ "skipped" the first compartment to enter within the second veil and work as Priest before the Father? Heb 9:1-10 relates the 1st compartment of the sanctuary to the old covenant. The ones carrying out the service of types, unlike Christ, needed daily to perform the work for their salvation. That is the whole point. We have fallen into sin. Thus our fallen natures has called for us to work daily. But the daily work ceases at the cross: therefore the places of the daily service are put out of commission: which includes the holy place. We will yet see this more when we look at the meaning and significance of the second veil further down. As for now: we will continue to observe some of what the Bible says concerning the levitical priesthood:

[Heb 7:18](verseid:58.7.18)  For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before ==for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof==.
[Heb 7:19](verseid:58.7.19)  For ==the law made nothing perfect==, but the bringing in of a better hope _did;_ by the which we draw nigh unto God.

[Rom 8:3](verseid:45.8.3)  For what the ==law could not do==, in that it was ==weak through the flesh==, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:

[Act 13:38](verseid:44.13.38)  Be it known unto you therefore, men _and_ brethren, that through ==this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins==:
[Act 13:39](verseid:44.13.39)  And ==by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses==.
[Act 13:40](verseid:44.13.40)  Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
[Act 13:41](verseid:44.13.41)  Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.

[Heb 8:7](verseid:58.8.7)  For ==if that first _covenant_ had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second==.
[Heb 8:8](verseid:58.8.8)  ==For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
[Heb 8:9](verseid:58.8.9)  Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
[Heb 8:10](verseid:58.8.10)  For this _is_ the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:==
[Heb 8:11](verseid:58.8.11)  And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
[Heb 8:12](verseid:58.8.12)  For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
[Heb 8:13](verseid:58.8.13)  In that he saith, A new _covenant,_ he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old _is_ ready to vanish away.

[Heb 7:11](verseid:58.7.11)  If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
[Heb 7:12](verseid:58.7.12)  ==For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.==
[Heb 7:13](verseid:58.7.13)  ==For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe==, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
[Heb 7:14](verseid:58.7.14)  For it is evident that ==our Lord sprang out of Juda==; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
[Heb 7:15](verseid:58.7.15)  And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
[Heb 7:16](verseid:58.7.16)  ==Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life==.

[Heb 10:8](verseid:58.10.8)  Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and _offering_ for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure _therein;_ which are offered by the law;
[Heb 10:9](verseid:58.10.9)  Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. ==He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.==
[Heb 10:10](verseid:58.10.10)  ==By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once _for all._==
> You see: We are sanctified through the sacrifice which Christ already made on the cross (Heb 10:29, Heb 9:13-28). This is why we are condemned if we dont believe and saved if we do (Jhn 3:16-21). Hebrews 10 continues to say:

[Heb 10:11](verseid:58.10.11)  And every priest ==standeth daily== ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
[Heb 10:12](verseid:58.10.12)  But this man, after he had offered ==one sacrifice== for sins for ever, ==sat down on the right hand of God==;
[Heb 10:13](verseid:58.10.13)  From henceforth expecting ==till his enemies be made his footstool==.
> Here again we see the same reference to Christ being given dominion over His enemies as we saw in Psa 2:8-9 and Isa 11:4. What is the pattern of the previous two? Christ is declared to be the Son of God, and ==then== it is said of Him that He will rule with a rod of iron, etc... . Following the pattern, we can associate Christ's distinction of priestly service (as seen in Heb 10:11-13 above) with the declaration that He is the Son of God, which truth we have seen to be declared at His anointing (being baptized in the Jordan).

[Heb 10:14](verseid:58.10.14)  For ==by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified== .
[Heb 10:15](verseid:58.10.15)  _Whereof_ ==the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us:== for after that he had said before,
[Heb 10:16](verseid:58.10.16)  This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
[Heb 10:17](verseid:58.10.17)  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
[Heb 10:18](verseid:58.10.18)  Now where remission of these _is, there is_ no more offering for sin. 

[Heb 7:23](verseid:58.7.23)  And they truly were ==many priests==, because they were ==not suffered to continue by reason of death==:
[Heb 7:24](verseid:58.7.24)  ==But this _man==,_ because he continueth ever, hath ==an unchangeable priesthood==.

### The earthly vs the heavenly sanctuary
[Heb 10:1](verseid:58.10.1)  For the law having a shadow of good things to come, _and_ ==not the very image of the things==, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
> This plainly states that the similarity between the earthly and heavenly sanctuary is not 1:1 in every particular. Lets further explore what that means.

⛳️
##### Point 1
 > We see Christ amongst the candlesticks in Rev 1. Is this proof in and of itself that Christ ascended to do the work of the holy place? Another question, which will help to answer this one, is: Did the high priest only deal with the second compartment (the most holy place) of the sanctuary on the day of atonement, or did he deal with all places (including the courtyard)? ~~If the answer to the second question is all, then that shows that the vision of Christ standing amongst the candlesticks is not enough proof, in and of itself, that Christ rather began the work of the holy place upon His ascension. We would need more than the vision of Christ amongst the candlesticks to have evidence that Christ went to a holy place in Heaven.~~ Lastly, where is the place where Christ is seen to walking amongst the candle sticks? This may seem like a weird question, since we know that the candle sticks in Rev 1 correspond to the lamp of the holy place of the Mosaic tabernacle (Exo 24:37-40). However, in order to give room for Heb 10:1, we should drop the expectation that the earthly sanctuary perfectly reveals the one in Heaven (in literal terms) and rather let the Bible answer this question from a clean slate.  So, with those questions being asked, lets see what the Bible says about the candle sticks:
 
 ⛳️
## Revelation 1:20   (KJV)

20  The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
>This is our first clue

## [Revelation 2:1](verseid:66.2.1)   (KJV)
1  Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

## Matthew 5:15-16   (KJV)
15  Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
16  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

## Philippians 2:15-16   (KJV)
15  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
16  Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.


 Zec 4:1  And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
Zec 4:2  And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all _of_ gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which _are_ upon the top thereof:
Zec 4:3  And two olive trees by it, one upon the right _side_ of the bowl, and the other upon the left _side_ thereof.
Zec 4:4  So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What _are_ these, my lord?
Zec 4:5  Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.
Zec 4:6  Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This _is_ the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.
Zec 4:7  Who _art_ thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel _thou shalt become_ a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone _thereof with_ shoutings, _crying,_ Grace, grace unto it.
Zec 4:8  Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Zec 4:9  The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
Zec 4:10  For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel _with_ those seven; they _are_ the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
Zec 4:11  Then answered I, and said unto him, What _are_ these two olive trees upon the right _side_ of the candlestick and upon the left _side_ thereof?
Zec 4:12  And I answered again, and said unto him, What _be these_ two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden _oil_ out of themselves?
Zec 4:13  And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these _be?_ And I said, No, my lord.
Zec 4:14  Then said he, These _are_ the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

> So we can conclude that, although we see the candlesticks in the holy place (first compartment) of the earthly sanctuary, and we see Christ amongst candlesticks in Heaven, ⛳️

##### Point 4
[Lev 10:16](verseid:3.10.16)  And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron _which were_ left _alive,_ saying,
[Lev 10:17](verseid:3.10.17)  Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it _is_ most holy, and _God_ hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?
[Lev 10:18](verseid:3.10.18)  ==Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy _place:_ ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy _place,_ as I commanded.==
> One thing to note is that the word atonement was used to describe the daily sacrificial work (Exo 29:36) as well as to the cleansing of the sanctuary or "the Day of Atonement" (Lev 16). Those two uses clearly point to two separate things. Therefore, it is not enough to say that, because the word "atonement" is used here, in Lev 10:17, means that it was the "Day of Atonement". In fact, supposing so would introduce confusion. Here's how: One of the requirements for the sacrifice, that was to be eaten in the holy place, was that its blood did not enter into the holy place. Moses saw that the goat met the requirements of a sacrifice which should be eaten and was mad because those whom he instructed to eat it didn't eat it. Outside of the initial setting up, anointing, and atonement work for the sanctuary, and the priests (Exo 29), the eating of the burnt offerings was only a part of the daily work (Lev 6:26) and not of the day of atonement (Lev 16). If the blood had entered into the holy place, the priests would not be permitted to eat it. The blood of sacrifice did however enter the holy place on the day of atonement. Therefore, we cannot suppose that the word "atonement" referred to the day of atonement, and also that the blood was not brought in. Such attempt brings in confusion. 
> Lets go on to see other scriptures which show that, in regular daily and yearly terms (excluding the initial setup of the sanctuary), the blood only entered into the holy place on the day of atonement:

[Exo 30:10](verseid:2.30.10)  And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: ==once in the year== shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it _is_ most holy unto the LORD.

[Heb 13:10](verseid:58.13.10)  We have an altar, whereof ==they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle==.
[Heb 13:11](verseid:58.13.11)  For the bodies of those beasts, whose ==blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest== for sin, are burned without the camp.
[Heb 13:12](verseid:58.13.12)  ==Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate==.

> So, again, from all of these scriptures (for this specific point) we can see that there was no blood taken into the sanctuary itself until the Day of Atonement. With that in mind, lets see whether Christ ascended to Heaven to apply His blood immediately or not:

## The seal of God

> We have talked about Rev 22:11 and the common thought that it is describing a world-wide close of probation. I say common in reference to Seventh-Day-Adventism as this is the religion that I am most aware of (having been born into, and living in it for 28 years). That being said, another common thought (teaching) is that the Sabbath is the seal of God and that one doesnt get the seal of God until the time of the test of the 3rd angel: where they will first have to prove their loyalty to God by keeping the Sabbath. The question we will answer in this section is: "What does the Bible say that the seal of God is?"
> We have already gone over scriptures which talked about the seal of God in Christ's own life, namely: Act 10:38, Jhn 3:34, and Isa 11:2-4 in conjunction with Luk 4:18-21. From them, we saw that Christ's anointing was done by, and through, the Holy Spirit. Lets keep these scriptures in mind as we go on to see how the Bible answers this question:

[Jhn 6:27](verseid:43.6.27)  Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

 ⛳️


> So, by many witnesses, it is clearly stated that we are sealed by/in the Spirit of God. What did Christ himself have to say about the matter?

[Jhn 6:35](verseid:43.6.35)  And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
[Jhn 6:36](verseid:43.6.36)  But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.
[Jhn 6:37](verseid:43.6.37)  All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
[Jhn 6:38](verseid:43.6.38)  For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.
[Jhn 6:39](verseid:43.6.39)  And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.
[Jhn 6:40](verseid:43.6.40)  And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

> He said that all who believe on Him should never thirst; in other words, such will have Him, the Fountain of water (life; the Bread of life), eternally (otherwise the word "never" wouldn't be used). He goes on to talk about how all, who will be saved, have ==already== been given {past tense} into His hand (otherwise He wouldnt be able to say that He wouldnt lose any of them if it wasnt past tense). How are these words from Christ in agreement with the teaching that we are not sealed until the Sabbath vs Sunday test in the end of the world? 

 ⛳️

> Why is it that it is impossiible to please God without His Spirit, that everyone who walks in His Spirit both pleases Him and is without sin, and that the unpardonable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? It is because it is by the Holy Ghost that we are sealed for eternity, and by the rejection of the Holy Ghost that we are marked for destruction (⛳️).

 ⛳️

### The veil 
⛳️(Add commentary an/or more scriptures to whole section)

> What did the veil represent, and why is that important in understanding the work that Christ began upon His ascension? We will see as we continue:

[Exo 40:3](verseid:2.40.3)  And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.

[Exo 26:33](verseid:2.26.33)  And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy _place_ and the most holy.

[Exo 34:30](verseid:2.34.30)  And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
[Exo 34:33](verseid:2.34.33)  And _till_ Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.
[Exo 34:34](verseid:2.34.34)  But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel _that_ which he was commanded.
[Exo 34:35](verseid:2.34.35)  And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

> [Exo 20:19](verseid:2.20.19)  And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
> Exo 20:19 shows even more of the sentiment which the children of Israel had concerning God's presence and glory.  
> So far, we see that the veil is for a covering; to hide something away. ⛳️
## [Leviticus 16:2](verseid:3.16.2)   (KJV)

2  And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy _place_ within the vail before the mercy seat, which _is_ upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

## [Leviticus 21:23](verseid:3.21.23)   (KJV)

23  Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

[Isa 59:2](verseid:23.59.2)  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid _his_ face from you, that he will not hear.

[Gen 24:65](verseid:1.24.65)  For she _had_ said unto the servant, What man _is_ this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant _had_ said, It _is_ my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

[Mat 1:23](verseid:40.1.23)  Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

[Heb 10:19](verseid:58.10.19)  Having therefore, brethren, ==boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus==,
[Heb 10:20](verseid:58.10.20)  By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, ==through the veil, that is to say, his flesh==;

[2Co 3:12](verseid:47.3.12)  Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
[2Co 3:13](verseid:47.3.13)  And not as Moses, _which_ put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
[2Co 3:14](verseid:47.3.14)  But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which _vail_ is done away in Christ.
[2Co 3:15](verseid:47.3.15)  But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
[2Co 3:16](verseid:47.3.16)  Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
##### The renting of the veil
## [Matthew 27:51](verseid:40.27.51)   (KJV)

51  And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

## [Mark 15:38](verseid:41.15.38)   (KJV)

38  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
## [Ephesians 2:15](verseid:49.2.15)   (KJV)

15  Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, _even_ the law of commandments _contained_ in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, _so_ making peace;

⛳️

> After 2Co 3:16 it continues:

[2Co 3:17](verseid:47.3.17)  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord _is,_ there _is_ liberty.
[2Co 3:18](verseid:47.3.18)  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, _even_ as by the Spirit of the Lord.



⛳️
[Isa 25:7](verseid:23.25.7)  And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
> In the end, the vail of the sky will be rolled away, and there will be nothing between us, this earth and God. All things will then be changed into His glory. The old will pass away (just as the old covenant passed away at the cross) and all things will be made new (reflecting the newness of life that Christ will have instilled into all that are God's). God will be with His people and with nothing in between.

[Rev 21:3](verseid:66.21.3)  And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God _is_ with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, _and be_ their God.
[Rev 21:4](verseid:66.21.4)  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.
[Rev 21:5](verseid:66.21.5)  And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.
[Rev 21:6](verseid:66.21.6)  And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.
[Rev 21:7](verseid:66.21.7)  He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
[Rev 21:8](verseid:66.21.8)  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
