[Heb 10:16](verseid:58.10.16)  This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
[Heb 10:17](verseid:58.10.17)  And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
[Heb 10:18](verseid:58.10.18)  Now where remission of these _is, there is_ no more offering for sin.

> Eph 4:8  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.

> Eph 4:13  Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
> Eph 4:14  That we _henceforth_ be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, _and_ cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
> Eph 4:15  But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, _even_ Christ:
> Eph 4:16  From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
