## [Hebrews 7:25](verseid:58.7.25)   (KJV)

25  Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

[Heb 9:14](verseid:58.9.14)  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
[Heb 9:15](verseid:58.9.15)  And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions _that were_ under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
